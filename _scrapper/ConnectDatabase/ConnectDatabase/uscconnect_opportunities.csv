Professor Slaughter is a former law professor and Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs at Princeton University. She left these positions in 2009 to serve as the first female Director of Public Policy for the U.S. State Department and is now the President and CEO of a bipartisan think tank. However, what makes her visit so exciting is an article she wrote in 2012 for The Atlantic, titled �Why Women Still Can�t Have It All.� This article is the most downloaded essay for The Atlantic (a copy of which is attached) and has generated a new debate concerning women and leadership, work/life balance, and expectations of leaders.

Camp Read-a-Rama YA (Young Adults) takes the same approach to serving tweens and teens ages 12-17. Each week features a theme and a corresponding set of books; activities that extend the book experience will include swimming, science and nature, outdoor education, field trips, hiking, aquatics, games, cooking, drama, nature crafts and more. Strong applicants will have had academic training in children�s literature (coursework in English, Library Science and/or Education) and/or recreation management, sciences, engineering and art education fields and previous experience working with children. Previous camp experience is desirable but not essential.  All interns must have excellent people skills, enthusiasm, lots of patience, positive energy, openness to new ideas and a love for reading and literature. All applicants must attend pre-camp May 27-30, and some professional development activities will also be scheduled during the last half of spring semester. Camp will run (in different locations throughout Columbia) from June 2-August 1. Strong applicants should be available for the entire camp season, but part-time internships will be considered. Students who are taking summer courses part of day can also be considered.  Highly desirable are Red Cross Lifeguarding and/or Water Safety Instructor certification and other aquatics trainings as well as song-leading experience.  Minority and male applicants are particularly encouraged to apply. All interns will gain valuable Community Engagement, Leadership and Work-Based Experience.  Those with special skills in Research may opt to work with the Research component of Camp Read-a-Rama. Through one summer of work with Camp Read-a-Rama, interns can complete all 300 hours for graduating with Leadership Distinction, but Camp Read-a-Rama is such a special program that first-time interns will certainly want to come back  for more summer camp and will want to maintain contact with the campers through our fall-spring community-based programs and share the program with other students.","2014-05-12","Community Service/Engagement; Internships or other Professional Work-based Experience; Leadership Program","","Summer","","All Students","","Video","","","","","","USC Columbia","0","Library and Information Science","","Dr. Michelle H.

Contest structure  Poetry Out Loud begins at the classroom level, with winners from each classroom advancing to a school-wide competition and then to regional competitions. Regional winners advance to South Carolina's statewide competition. Ultimately, one student from each state will compete in the national finals in Washington, D.C.     Student Eligibility  Only high school students in grades 9-12 are eligible, with an exception made for 8th grade students who are in a participating 9th through 12th grade class. Competitors at the state and national finals must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Students are responsible for verifying their eligibility. Schools must register with their state Poetry Out Loud coordinator in order to participate in the official state competition. A student may not advance to the state finals without competing in a lower-level competition. Homeschooled students may participate by competing in a contest at a local school (at the school�s discretion) or with other local homeschooled students. The state Poetry Out Loud coordinator should be consulted for guidance on participation. A school-level competition must include at least two students. Students unable to participate at a local school should contact their state Poetry Out Loud coordinator to discuss any other opportunities for inclusion in the state�s official competition. A National Champion is not eligible to compete in subsequent years.     Partners  Statewide partners include the Columbia Museum of Art, the South Carolina Department of Education and South Carolina ETV Radio's �Speaking of Schools� Program with Doug Keel.

"219","Undergraduate Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activities","http://www.sc.edu/our/","Discovery for all disciplines: Students use discipline specific methodology to address a research, scholarly, or creative issue in collaboration with or under the supervision of a faculty/staff mentor. The research question or project can be developed by the mentor or the student. This is an opportunity for students to learn more about what they are interested in and to apply what is being learned in the classroom. Research can be done in conjunction with many other experiences such as: an international experience/study abroad, an internship/work-based experience, community service, national/domestic experience, or leadership.     Specific duties vary by project. Students may volunteer, get academic credit (usually an independent study), or receive stipend support. Length of project varies significantly but often involves 5-15 hours of work per week, and lasts 2 semesters or more.

She lived as simple a life as I could imagine, one where dirt floors, no shoes and no indoor plumbing were the norm. While sitting on a tattered pink couch in her small kitchen I watched, out of the corner of my eye, chickens running through her yard and her daughter counting black beans at the kitchen table. I continued with my battery of questions including what level of education she had completed and how many individuals lived in her incredibly small home. I began to realize just how many worlds away I was from this culture and way of life. As I continued on this journey to provide rudimentary healthcare to the people of Belize however, these differences became less and less obvious, as the peoples� need for medical attention merged with my desire to help them.  Through an International Service Learning trip to Belize during my spring break, I was able to experience both the hospital and clinical settings of a developing country. I began my personal journey meeting with the diverse communities whom populated the small villages of Belize. I was able to relate to the people I saw in the clinic and hospital, making it my responsibility to put them at ease. I broke down barriers with my compassion and felt a renewed energy take over as I stepped outside of myself and began exploring the lives of those in need. In response, I was welcomed into their homes and even offered cake at their two-year-old�s birthday party. They shared their homes and their food graciously with strangers that came unannounced, dressed in scrubs. In return, I worked tirelessly for these people who became my patients and I treated as my friends. I made sure we moved swiftly through the villages to get to as many houses as possible, giving out all of our appointment cards, but also making a point to provide meaningful, personable healthcare.

The work is professional in nature and is designed to further the student�s knowledge of, and skills in, the industry. The work is typically related to the student�s course of study or future career goals.     Duration/Format: The co-op program at USC allows students to participate in 2-3 semesters of paid work-based learning with the same employer through one of two formats:    Parallel:  Students work part-time (20 hrs/wk) while attending school for 3 consecutive *semesters.     Alternating:  Students work a minimum of 2 semesters full-time (40 hrs/wk) while alternating semesters of working and attending school. This option allows students to live and work in other parts of the country.   * semester = fall, spring or summer    Compensation:  Co-op positions are always paid and salaries are competitive - typically close to the hourly equivalent of an entry level full-time position - but can also provide a set salary/stipend.  Additional compensation such as travel expenses, housing allowances and/or benefits may also be offered.      Supervision:  The work/learning arrangement is directly supervised by a designated employee of the employer and is monitored by a University of South Carolina Career Center staff member.      Recognition:  Students do not typically earn academic credit but the co-op experience is documented on the student�s academic transcript.","2015-07-01","Internships or other Professional Work-based Experience","","Fall Semester; Spring Semester; Summer","","All Students","","Other","Varies but always includes student mid- and end-of-semester evaluations & supervisor evaluations","Networking Her Way!

Alternating co-op students must have 1 full-time semester of coursework/enrollment left at USC following their final work term (students may not co-op during their final semester unless completing a parallel co-op).      Intentionality and reflection:  An integral component of the co-op experience that distinguishes it from other types of work is one or more forms of structured and deliberate reflection contained within learning agendas or objectives.

Hilary grew up in Lexington, South Carolina, but her dad and his side of the family are from Alabama and her older brother is currently a student at UA.  She applied and was accepted to Alabama during her college search, but at the very last minute decided to come to USC after a great campus tour.  Hilary stated, �Even though I am from the Columbia area I'd never really been on the USC campus.  I was afraid that the university was really spread out without any true campus feel, but after seeing everything on the tour I realized that the campus is actually compact and very pretty. I was impressed!�  	During Orientation when students could sign up to receive emails about various campus offices, resources, and organizations, Hilary signed up to hear from the Office of Student Engagement.  One of those emails mentioned the National Student Exchange, a program coordinated by the Office of Student Engagement.  Hilary then went to an information session about the program and started the process of applying for exchange.  Choosing the University of Alabama was an easy decision since she had seriously considered going there and so many members of her family live nearby or attend UA, including her brother and some cousins.  Hilary said, �I�m actually the first in several generations not to go to UA, so I figured I'd do this exchange and see what all the fuss is about!�  	Hilary spent the Fall 2011 semester at the University of Alabama and had a fabulous experience, mentioning that �Tuscaloosa is a really great community with a lot of character and tradition.� She loved experiencing all the campus traditions at UA and being in a die-hard college football town. Hilary mentioned that one of the most fun things for her was experiencing their football Saturdays. �Saturdays are great. Saturdays in Columbia are great too, but there�s something about winning all the time that is so satisfactory.� She also had the chance to explore many new places while participating in NSE. �I also got to visit different areas of Alabama, and went to Tennessee and Mississippi. I am going hiking next week in Moundville, and I�ve really enjoyed going to the Black Warrior River.� Hilary had a great experience in the classroom as well, stating that �I really liked that all of my classes were small�between 15 and 40 people. I got to take some interesting classes�like the psychology of coaching and interpersonal communication.�    	As she looks back on her experience at UA, she recognizes some of the benefits she got from exchange and how she changed. She said, �I�m surprised at the change of heart that I�ve had during my time here. When I first arrived, I wanted to turn around and go back home immediately. Now that it�s nearly time to go, I am scrambling to get all my adventures in! I�m not ready to leave!� She also mentioned that overall she had a great experience spending time in Tuscaloosa and with her family. �I am really, really happy about all of the time that I got to spend with my grandparents and cousins. It has really meant a lot to them, and to me. I was able to make connections with my family. I would not have had the chance to do that if I hadn�t done this exchange.�   	Students who are interested in participating in the National Student Exchange can request to be placed at participating NSE schools in the United States, Canada, and U.S. Territories.  An exchange can last for a semester, a summer, or a full year.  Students will pay University of South Carolina tuition, but are responsible for the cost of housing and additional fees of their host institution.  They can use any remaining financial aid toward those fees.  In order to be considered for the National Student Exchange, students must have completed at least 30 credit hours, have a minimum 2.5 GPA, and be in good academic and judicial standing.  Special exchanges for Honors students and Resident Assistants/Mentors are available.

Theatre South Carolina casts a number of non-students every year, if not in every show. Production is an extension of teaching, so students' needs are one factor considered in casting, but not the only factor.    TSC tries to audition all shows for a semester at one time. The directors for each show together with the Artistic Director and the acting faculty decide on casting. Occasionally some parts will be cast before auditions; this is always true in the case of guest actors.    TSC embraces non-traditional casting. The use of ethnic minority actors, female actors, and physically-challenged actors is encouraged where these elements are not essential to the story of the play.    Actors should sign up for audition times before the audition nights in the Department office, 4th floor of Longstreet Theatre. Some scripts will be available for checkout in the Department office before auditions.    Auditions are usually held in the acting studios on the first floor of Booker T. Washington Auditorium, entered from Wheat Street between Pickens and Bull Streets.    Generally, actors are expected to present a short monologue at the first auditions. For the exact nature of the monologue, see the posting for a specific show in the Department office. Sides are provided to be read at call-backs. Call-backs are posted in the Department office. Casting will also be posted in the Department office.

Students will receive a background in the park�s natural resources and on-going research and resource management at the Park.  Students will also study the cultural history of the park, including historic and current uses of the park, the rich cultural legacy deriving from those historic uses, and how the community�s relationship to the park continues to play out today.
