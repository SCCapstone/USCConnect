# USCConnect
Android app for [USC Connect](http://www.sc.edu/uscconnect/).

## Using the App

To begin using the app, [download](http://cse.sc.edu/~ammer/USCConnect.apk) the .apk and install.

Once the app is running, you will be at the main page with four buttons:
* "Search Opportunities"
* "Student Log"
* "GLD Application"
* "About USC Connect"

The "Search Opportunities"

The "Student Log" page has an "Add" button that then lets the user input text into a title and body field, and then can click "Save" to save the text. Each entry is clickable to view the text that was previously entered.

The "GLD Application" page opens a browser and direct the user to the school's GLD login page.

The "About USC Connect" page has a clickable youtube video at the top of the screen, followed by a small paragraph of text, with links to USC Connect's facebook, instagram, and twitter account pages.
